            <p><b>Epistemology</b> is a philosophical concept that focuses on knowledge; its extent, boundaries, and limitations. This work addresses issues about the process of learning, what is knowledge, the requirements for warranting beliefs and the very concepts of truth and belief . At its heart, epistemology attempts to examine what is knowledge, how people acquire knowledge, and why people believe things.</p>

        <h1>Empiricism</h1>
<div class="container-Emp">
        <p>
            Philosophical empiricism posits that experience, observation, and sensory perception are the main sources for knowledge formation. Empiricism proposes that all knowledge comes from or can be proved via empirical experience. Here, it is different from rationalism, which argues that reason and innate ideas hold more importance in gaining knowledge.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Sensory Experience:</b> Empiricists say, we do not learn anything from birth and knowledge starts with seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting or smelling. Such knowledge forms our foundation of the universe.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Tabula Rasa:</b> It is very much related to the tabula rasa principle of empowerment where “tabula rasa” means “blank slate”. Philosophers such as John Locke posited that the mind comes into being as a clean tablet, and all knowledge can be derived from experiences that inscribe onto this mental tablet.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Observation and Experimentation:</b> Accordingly, empiricism attaches much importance to the view of the external world. The empirical method consists of careful observations, measurements and experiments for obtaining information and making inferences.

            <h1>Rationalism</h1>
            <div class="container-Ratio">
                <p>
                    Rationalism is a philosophical perspective that places a strong emphasis on reason, logic, and intellectual analysis as the primary sources of knowledge. Unlike empiricism, which asserts that knowledge is derived from sensory experience, rationalism holds that certain truths and principles are known independently of experience and can be grasped through the exercise of reason.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Reason as the Source of Knowledge:</b> Rationalists say that reason should be the fundamental foundation of all knowledge as opposed to sensory experience. They argue that there are some universal truths and principles which could be determined by the use of reason.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Innate Ideas:</b> Inherent in rationalism is the concept of innate ideas, which are supposedly inborn in nature. René Descartes and other philosophers argue that some primary concepts lie within human minds and knowledge involves merely discovering or comprehending such ideas.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Deductive Reasoning:</b> Rationalism is based on deductive reasoning, wherein particular conclusions or inferences are drawn from one or more general notions, ideas or precepts. This is different from inductive reasoning where one seeks principles that are generally applicable from specific observations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Mathematics and Geometry:</b> Sometimes rationalists argue that mathematics and geometry are disciplines that yield knowledge through pure reason. Rationalists argue that the certainty and universality in the case of mathematical truths indicate that not all knowledge is dependent on sensory experience.

        <h1>Famous Philosophers in Epistemology</h1>
        <div class="container-Philo">
            <h2>Plato</h2>
            <p>
                Plato was an ancient Greek philosopher born in Athens during the Classical period. In Athens, Plato founded the Academy, a philosophical school where he taught the philosophical doctrines that would later become known as Platonism.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Aristotle</h2>
            <p>
                Aristotle was an Ancient Greek philosopher and polymath. His writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology and the arts. Aristotle made significant contributions to epistemology, emphasizing the importance of empirical observation, the classification of knowledge through categories, the understanding of substance and essence, the principle of noncontradiction, and an analytical method. His ideas influenced the development of Western thought on the nature and acquisition of knowledge.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Socrates</h2>
            <p>
                Socrates was an ancient Greek philosopher who lived in Athens during the 5th century BCE. He is renowned for his contributions to ethics, epistemology, and the Socratic method—a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue to stimulate critical thinking. Unlike other philosophers of his time, Socrates didn't leave written records of his teachings; his ideas were primarily transmitted through the works of his students, most notably Plato. Socrates' philosophical inquiries often centered on moral principles, virtue, and the pursuit of knowledge, and he is best known for his relentless questioning of others to encourage self-examination and intellectual exploration. Socrates' method and ideas laid the groundwork for subsequent Western philosophical thought. His life and death are prominently featured in Plato's dialogues, especially in "Apology," "Crito," and "Phaedo." Socrates was sentenced to death by drinking hemlock, as he chose not to compromise his philosophical principles during his trial in Athens.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>René Descartes</h2>
            <p>
                René Descartes (1596–1650), a French philosopher and mathematician, is known as the father of modern philosophy. His method of radical doubt sought indubitable knowledge, leading to the famous statement "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"). Descartes proposed mind-body dualism, distinguishing between the mind and the body. He championed mathematical reasoning for certainty, made significant contributions to analytic geometry, and formulated an ontological argument for the existence of God. His work laid the foundation for modern philosophy, influencing discussions on consciousness, reason, and the nature of reality.
