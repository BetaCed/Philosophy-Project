                        <li><span>Aesthetics in Philosophy</span><br>Aesthetics is a branch of inquiry that delves into the nature of beauty, art, and taste, as well as the creation and appreciation of beauty. It seeks to unravel the criteria for judging beauty, understand the role of the artist, and examine the relationship between art and society. Moreover, aesthetics contemplates the values we assign to beauty and expresses them through opinions and judgments, be it in the realm of art, music, or nature.</li>
                        <li><span>Aesthetics and Beauty</span><br> explores the reciprocal influence between art, society, and culture, shedding light on how art shapes our values, beliefs, and identity. Throughout history, aesthetics philosophy has enthralled scholars, artists, and thinkers, inviting various perspectives on the subject.
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Aesthetics questions</span><br> "What is a work of art?", "What makes a work of art successful?", "Why do we find certain things beautiful?", "How can things of very different categories be considered equally beautiful?", "Is there a connection between art and morality?", "Can art be a vehicle of truth?", "Are aesthetic judgments objective statements or purely subjective expressions of personal attitudes?", "Can aesthetic judgments be improved or trained?"
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-contents" id="try pics">
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Aesthetic Judgements</span><br>-Judgements of aesthetic value rely on our ability to discriminate at a sensory level, but they usually go beyond that. Judgments of beauty are sensory, emotional, and intellectual all at once.
                            <br>-Judgments of aesthetic value can also become linked to judgments of economic, political or moral value (e.g. we might judge an expensive car to be beautiful partly because it is desirable as a status symbol, or we might judge it to be repulsive partly because it signifies for us over-consumption and offends our political or moral values.)
                            </li>
                        <li><span>Aesthetic Universals</span><br>The contemporary American philosopher Denis Dutton (1944 - 2010) has identified seven universal signatures in human aesthetics. 
                            <br> 1. <b>Expertise or Virtuosity</b> (technical artistic skills are cultivated, recognized and admired)
                            <br> 2. <b>Non-Utilitarian Pleasure</b> (people enjoy art for art's sake, and don't demand practical value of it)
                            <br> 3. <b>Style</b> (artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in recognizable styles)
                            <br> 4. <b>Criticism</b> (people make a point of judging, appreciating and interpreting works of art)
                            <br> 5. <b>Imitation</b> (with a few important exceptions (e.g. music, abstract painting), works of art simulate experiences of the world)
                            <br> 6. <b>Special Focus</b> (art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience)
                            <br> 7. <b>Imagination</b> (artists and their audiences entertain hypothetical worlds in the theater of the imagination)
                            </li>
                        <li><span>History of Aesthetic</span><br>The first important contributions to aesthetic theory are usually considered to stem from philosophers in Ancient Greece, among which the most noticeable are Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus. When interpreting writings from this time, it is worth noticing that it is debatable whether an exact equivalent to the term beauty existed in classical Greek.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The Ancient Greek philosophers initially felt that aesthetically appealing objects were beautiful in and of themselves. Plato felt that beautiful objects incorporated proportion, harmony and unity among their parts. Aristotle found that the universal elements of beauty were order, symmetry and definiteness.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The first use of the term aesthetics in something like its modern sense is commonly attributed to Alexander Baumgarten in 1735, although earlier studies in the 18th century by writers such as the third Earl of Shaftesbury (Anthony Ashley Cooper), Joseph Addison, Jean-Baptiste Du Bos, and Francis Hutcheson mark the first systematic inquiries into aesthetics in its familiar sense as a distinct branch of philosophy.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-contents" id="ewan ko">
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Plato</span><br>According to Plato, there is a perfect Form of Beauty in which beautiful things participate.  For thinkers such as Augustine and Pseudo-Dionysius, platonic forms (including the form of Beauty) are in fact ideas in the mind of God, and the world is but a shadow of the divine image. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Plato’s most prominent contribution to aesthetics is his notion of mimesis (imitation). Mimesis derives from the idea that beautiful things are mere replicas of Beauty itself. So conceived, beautiful things participate in the Forms by means of imitation.
                            </li>
                        <li><span>Aristotle</span><br>Aristotle emphasized some characteristics that art requires in order to be good. “Beauty is a matter of size and order” (Aristotle, Poetics, 1450b37).</li>
                        <li><span>Plotinus</span><br>The Neoplatonic philosopher Plotinus provided two main contributions to guide medieval thinking on aesthetics. First, Plotinus made it clear that beauty chiefly applies to the sense of sight and hearing (Plotinus I.6.1), which was maintained in the Middle Ages and second, Plotinus argued against the notion that proportion is the primary component of beauty. “Almost everyone declares that symmetry of parts towards each other and towards a whole, with, besides, a certain charm of color, constitutes the beauty recognized by the eye, that in visible things, as indeed in all else, universally, the beautiful thing is essentially symmetrical, patterned” (Plotinus I.6.1).

    <div class="services-list">
        <div>
            <h2>Metaphysics</h2>
           <p>refers to the branch of philosophy that attempts to understand the fundamental nature of all reality, whether visible or invisible. Metaphysical studies generally seek to explain inherent or universal elements of reality which are not easily discovered or experienced in our everyday life. As such, it is concerned with explaining the features of reality that exist beyond the physical world and our immediate senses. Metaphysics is both fundamental to philosophy and closely related to other philosophical subjects such as epistemology, ethics, and other studies of philosophy. Through out the centuries, different philosophers have provided differing interpretations and answers to metaphysical concerns, resulting in many types of thought such as realism, idealism, materialism, dualism, monism, and others.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Concepts</h2>
            <p>Metaphysics is concerned with the fundamental nature of reality, existence and the universe's fundamental structure. Additionally it is also a concept or imagined reality. And the connection between the world's physical and non-physical components that is beyond human perception.
                <br>
                <br>Metaphysics affects various areas of human life, including philosophy, religion, science, and even personal worldviews. It explores fundamental questions about the nature of reality, existence, consciousness, and the relationship between the physical and non-physical aspects of the universe. It can influence how we perceive the world, our beliefs about the nature of existence, and our understanding of concepts such as time, space, and causality.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Philosophers Involved</h2>
            <p><b>Plato (384 BC–322 BC)</b> – according to Plato the world of being is the fundamental dimension of reality and is constituted by the forms. This reality is only accessible through reason (the world of becoming). Since the true nature of something and its essence is given by its Form, then the only way we can come to know the truth is through reasoning. Plato’s answer is that the world of becoming. The world of material stuff participates in the world of being. Many find this answer wanting more. It also seems question-begging since this answer seems to simply rephrase the issue of how Form and matter interact if they exist in two fundamentally different dimensions.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>David K. Lewis (1941–2001)</b> - Lewis’s argument for concrete modal realism has two main parts. The first part consists in arguing for the ‘realist’ part of concrete modal realism, thereby providing reasons against the alternative of taking the modal operators as primitive. His argument for this consists in showing what possible worlds are good for. He highlights some things that can be done, or can more easily be done if possible are as real as the actual world we inhabit.</p>

                <h3>Epistemology</h3>
                <p>Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of knowledge. It seeks to answer the fundamental question of "How do we know?" by exploring the nature of concepts, the process of constructing them, the validity of our senses, logical reasoning, and all things related to the mind such as thoughts, ideas, memories, and emotions. In simpler terms, epistemology is concerned with understanding how our minds relate to reality and whether these relationships are valid or not.</p>

                <h3>Priori and Posteriori</h3>
                <p>the terms "a priori" and "a posteriori" refer to two different ways of acquiring knowledge or justification, based on the relationship between the evidence or justification and the truth of a proposition.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Priori: Knowledge independent of experience. A proposition is knowable a priori if it can be known through reasoning alone.

                    <br>
                    Posteriori: Knowledge dependent on experience. A proposition is knowable a posteriori if its truth or falsehood can only be determined through observation.

            <p>A philosopher from the 17th century, played a significant role in promoting the idea of empiricism. According to Locke, all our knowledge comes from our experiences through our senses. He introduced the concept of "tabula rasa," which suggests that our minds start as blank slates, and we acquire knowledge by interacting with the world around us. His viewpoint highlights the importance of observing, experimenting, and using real-world evidence to develop our understanding.</p>

                <h2>What is Ethics</h2>
                <p>Ethics is the philosophical study of morality. It is one of the main branches of philosophy which corresponds to the traditional division of philosophy into formal, natural and moral philosophy. It can be turned into a general study of goodness, right action, applied ethics, meta-ethics, moral psychology and metaphysics of moral responsibility</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2> History of Ethics</h2>
                <p>Ancient ethical thinking begins with the Greek Sophists of the fifth century B.C.E. and ends with the fall of Rome. Medieval philosophy is the philosophy of Western Europe from about AD 400-1400, approximately the period between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance. Modern Philosophy begins after the Renaissance (circa 1600) and continues until the present day.</p>g of Ethics</b>: The word Ethics is derived from the Greek word ‘ethos’ which means character or conduct. Ethics is also called moral philosophy or philosophical thinking about morality. This morality has been further elaborated as action and behavior which is concerned with ‘good’ or ‘evil’, of particular traditions, groups or individuals.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2> Philosophers of Ethics</h2>
                <p><b>PROTAGORAS</b><br>
                    One of the earliest sophists, Protagoras, denied the existence of objective moral truth and defended a version of moral relativism. He emphasized the extent to which moral codes are human creations, sets of customs practiced and upheld by particular communities. In Plato’s Theaetetus, he is said to have claimed that “whatever the city establishes as just, is just for that city as long as it judges so.” (Theaetetus 177d)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>SOCRATES</b> <br>The Father of Ethics and Inquiry
                    Socrates, who once observed that “the unexamined life is not worth living,” must be regarded as one of the greatest teachers of ethics. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ARISTOTLE</b><br>
                    Aristotle was Plato’s student, so we should not be surprised to see him developing similar ethical views. Still, there are differences of emphasis, points on which Aristotle is more explicit, and some points of clear disagreement between them.
